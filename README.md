MERN Stack Full Ecommerce Site - Using  React, Redux, Node.js

A binary tree is a tree data structure in software engineering in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to     as the **left child** and the **right child**.  
  
A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are bin    ary trees or an empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
